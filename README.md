## Why I Made This Project

As a frontend developer learning web technologies, this project is one of my initial attempts at combining various techniques. Inspired by a YouTube tutorial, I decided to personalize it by using a video background of water layers instead of a static image. This modification allowed me to explore working with video elements in HTML and CSS and add a unique touch to my project.
